abstract: The ultrasound (US) imaging technique has been applied to scoliosis assessment, and the proxy Cobb angle can be acquired on the US coronal images. The spinous process angle (SPA) is a valuable parameter to indicate 3-D deformity of spine. However, the SPA cannot be measured on US images since the spinous process (SP) is merged in the soft tissue layer and impossible to be identified on the coronal view directly. A new method based on the gradient vector flow (GVF) snake model was proposed to automatically locate SP position on the US transverse images, and the density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) was used to remove the outliers out of the detected location results. With marking the SP points on the US coronal image, the SP curve was interpolated and the SPA was measured. The algorithm was evaluated on 50 subjects with various severity of scoliosis, and two raters measured the SPA on both US images and radiographs manually. The mean absolute differences (MADs) of SPAs obtained from the two modalities were 3.4° ± 2.4° and 3.6° ± 2.8° for the two raters, respectively, which were less than the clinical acceptance error (5°), and the results reported a good linear correlation ( r > 0.85) between the US method and radiography. It indicates that the proposed method can be a promising approach for SPA measurement using the US imaging technique.
